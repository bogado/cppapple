== Porting to linapple to the latest {cxx}

This is an attempt to port this to the latest C++ possible.
The goal is to first have fun addapting the architecture.
Make the `#define` and globals oriented into a encapsuled one.

== Goals 

. No preprossor directives.
+
Some people love it, but I hate it, so no `#defines`

. No globals.
+
Encapsulate everything.

. Small components.
+
As much as possible try to keep files, classes and functions small.

== Previously forked by 
Port of linapple2b optimized for front end usage.
